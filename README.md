# obkv-table-client-rs

OBKV Table Client is Rust Library that can be used to access table data from [OceanBase](https://github.com/oceanbase/oceanbase) storage layer. Its access method is different from JDBC, it skips the SQL parsing layer, so it has significant performance advantage.

## Examples
A simple example could be found in [Demo](https://github.com/oceanbase/obkv-table-client-rs/blob/main/docs/simple_demo/simple_operation/demo.md).

## Acknowledgment
The CeresDB team implemented this rust client from scratch. Thanks to the [CeresDB](https://github.com/CeresDB/ceresdb) team (CeresDB is a high-performance, distributed, cloud native time-series database).
